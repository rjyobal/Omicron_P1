# US ELECTIONS: A BRIEF STORY
## THE OMICRONS TEAM – DATA ANALYTICS BOOTCAMP
### Introduction

Deemed as one of the most influential democratic procedures in the world, US elections are always a source of interest and polemic around the candidates and voting power themselves.
Amidst one of the worst economic crises in world’s history, the 2020 elections will define a solid decision of what Americans believe about leadership and ideology. Historical data has shown a clear trend about preferences and the constitution of the people behind this democracy.

### Demographics analysis

Beginning with the number of participants, American people are growing more skeptical about their candidates and results, as the overall participation is decreasing. We mean that only 56% of the total voting population did exercised its right to vote, while a 55.97% is predicted to vote this year.
As for a further breakdown on demographics, we know that the older Americans are, the more share they’ve got about voting. For the ranges 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 years old, we’ll experience a growth in participation around 1%, while the ranges for 18 to 24 and 65 and over, an almost nil change will be perceived ( growth and decrease are no larger than 1% respectively)
Change in participation for races include White, White non-Hispanic, Black, Asian and Pacific Islander and Hispanics. Predicted change won’t be perceived in this section as no more than 1% would be realized, except for Hispanics.
Past demographic elections, analyzing by age range, show us that in the majority it is adult people who attend to vote. Regarding gender in past elections, the figures show us that it is the female who exercises the majority the vote. For the issue on race, it is indicative that the "White non-Hispanic" race as classified are those who obtain the highest score exercising the vote

### Voting trends analysis

Although voting trends show us that popular preferences choose a Democrat candidate, Republicans have won more elections, at least, since 1976. Historically, we can identify both Democrat and Republican states by their overall vote counting, in which California and New York outstand with a dark blue whereas red is the color for Texas and Wyoming. 

### Historical Data

When we looked at the historical data for the last 11 years (1976-2016), we can tell the level of participation thru the course of the last years has been increased.
Based only on the vote count in which Republican party has won 5 out of the 11 US elections, leaving 6 to Democrats.
We observed the volume of votes does not always tell the winner of the election; it will depend on which state those votes were registered. This has a strong relationship with the US Electoral college system where each state gets a certain number of electors.

### Polls analysis

At the end of the day, popular vote can significantly change over the course of time, leaving little space for a correction just before the election day. These votes are not necessarily determinant for giving the victory to a candidate, in which the Electoral College takes a relevant participation, although our findings are about the change of them. Pointing out, the preferences seem to change about 1 month prior to Election Day. An important change is perceived in 2020, were a larger difference between the two candidates is shown.

### Conclusion 

American elections are a major world-defining course event, where even other countries will result affected or benefited from the POTUS policies and decisions. As such a determining event, it is important to analyze voting trends and to revert to historical decisions that have made the US an enduring nation. Should the country remain a world leader? Or shall it become a shadow of its own past? The people would decide…
